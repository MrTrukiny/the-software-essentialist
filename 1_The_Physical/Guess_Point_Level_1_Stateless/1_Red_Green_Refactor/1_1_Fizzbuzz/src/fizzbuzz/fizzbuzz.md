# Fizzbuzz

> Write a function that takes numbers from 1 to 
100 and outputs them as a string, but for multiples of 
three it returns “Fizz” instead of the number, and for
 multiples of five it returns “Buzz.” For numbers that 
are multiples of both three and five, 
it returns “FizzBuzz.”

- It outputs numbers as strings
- It accepts numbers between 1 and 100
- It rejects numbers lower than 1
- It rejects numbers greater than 100
